# TDD Exercise
In this exercise, you'll be practicing your Test Driven Development skills. Before you get started, let's start the services.

* Start/Stop the PostgreSQL server
* Create and Populate the database, if not already
* Start the frontend server
* Start the backend server
* Complete the ToDos, and test out the behavior in the web app interface again.


## ToDo
First you'll write 2 or more tests to address expected behavior to search for a book by title in `test_flask.py`. Write those tests first and ensure that they fail by running `python test_flaskr.py` from the backend folder. 


## TDD Practice (Continued)

After you see your tests fail, write the solution code in `__init__.py` by writing a new endpoint or updating a previous endpoint. At last, **test out the behavior in the web app interface again**.
