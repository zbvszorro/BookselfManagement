## About the Great Bookshelf of Udacity

This project is a virtual bookshelf for Udacity students. Students are able to add their books to the bookshelf, give them a rating, update the rating and search through their book lists. This project will serve as a practice module for the current course. By completing this project, students learn and apply their skills structuring and implementing well-formatted API endpoints that leverage the knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. 

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

* **What we expect from you?**<br>
You'll use this base in various workspaces throughout the course to build the project incrementally as you expand your skills. At each stage, there will be **various 'TODO's marked for you to complete.** You'll also notice some TODOs in the frontend section in the upcoming workspaces. 

You should feel free to expand on the project in any way you can dream up to extend your skills. For instance, you could add additional book information to each entry or create individual book views including more information about the book, your thoughts, or when you completed it. 

### Exercise starter code and solution

The solution for each exercise is present in the corresponding *Review* folder.
